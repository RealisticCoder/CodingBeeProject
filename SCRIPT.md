
## Introduction
Pranav: Good Morning Everyone Present here and the respected jury.
My name is Pranav.

Omeshwar: And My name is Omeshwar.
We are from Podar International School, Vadodara.

Pranav: We are thankful for this immense opportunity that we presenting our idea on this huge platform.

## Idea/Project
Omeshwar: So, our whole project is based on healthcare.
And as we all know that nowadays people are very busy in this modern world. People are searching for online medicines and checkup as this way is more convient to for them instead of waiting for long hours in the hosiptals and medical store.

Pranav: That's why we have choosen this theme and created this website based on healthcare.
And codingbee has given us this opportunity to express our idea.

## Body
Pranav: Pranav: So this site, is a demo site that we have created for Medcare Hospital. Obvisouly medcare is not a real hospital, but if we are using this template with any real hospital we can change the content accordingly as we have added the most common features every hospital website has. 

Omeshwar: So we have created the interface simple and classic so that any common people who is not much familar with the technology can use the website smoothly without any problems. Each and every main contents are avaliable on the home page that can be easily accessbile. 

Pranav: For Example, we have created an section of book appointment where anyone can fill the basic details like name, mobile number, email id and book appointment with one of our doctors based on the disease they have choosen.
So, as we told that this is a demo website related to a medcare hospital, if we are working with an real hospital site 
e can add others services which they are providing but in this we have included the most common services that each and every hospital has. 

Omeshwar: Also the images we have used in this site are vector images not real images as medcare is not a real hospital. We have used vector images because they are copyright free and all the images can be used in svg format which is very good for the SEO of the website. Accordinly if we are working with a real hospital we can add their own images in place of vector images so that it can look more realistic.

Pranav: Our main aim is that every common person should able to access all the information realted to hospital and get a smooth experience with our website as well as our hospital. Now we have completed why we have created this website. 

Omeshwar: So now let me tell you which elements we have used in this website. 
So our main sections include, Our Speciality, Our services, About us, Book Now, and a specially dedicated section for covid 19.

Pranav: Also our site is fully responsivess, and compatible with all devices.
We have also hosted this website on github pages.

## Conclusion
Omeshwar: So we have completed our speech, if you have any questions you can ask?
